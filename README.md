# 🎓 OD Management System (College)

## 📌 Overview

This project develops a **web-based application** to manage the **On Duty (OD) approval process** in our college. It replaces the manual, paper-based system with a digital workflow.

* **Current Process**: Students write a letter, attach evidence, get sequential signatures (**Class Incharge → Academic Head → HOD**), and then share the OD with faculty handling classes that day.
* **Goal**: Automate OD requests, approvals, and notifications.
* **Output**: Role-based dashboards for students and faculty, OD status tracking, and digital records.

## 🏗 Tech Stack

**Backend & Frontend**

* Django (Django Templates for UI)
* Django ORM for database models

**Database Models**

* `Student`: Roll number, department, section, year
* `Faculty`: Faculty code, department, role (HOD, Academic Head, Class Incharge, etc.)
* `Class`: Section, year, department, with mapped students & faculty
* `student_OD`: OD requests with event details, dates, approvals
* `faculty_OD`: OD requests by faculty

**Other**

* Excel import support with `openpyxl`
* File uploads (evidence proofs)

---

## 🔄 Workflow / Approach

### 1. Student Request

* Student logs in with roll number.
* Applies for OD with event details, dates, and uploads proof.
* Can add teammates for team ODs.

### 2. Sequential Approval

* Request flows to **Class Incharge**.
* If approved → moves to **Academic Head**.
* If approved → moves to **HOD**.
* At any stage → can be **rejected**.

### 3. Notification & Attendance

* Approved ODs visible in dashboards.
* Faculty can see which students are on OD for their classes/dates.
